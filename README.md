## Projects

This report examines global CO₂ emission trends over 50 years using Our World in Data sources. It analyzes emissions distribution, historical responsibilities, and the correlation between GDP growth and emissions. Findings reveal that global CO₂ emissions have doubled since 1972, with China and India as the largest current emitters, while developed nations like the U.S. hold significant historical responsibility. Additionally, the analysis shows that a 1% increase in GDP corresponds to a 0.298% rise in CO₂ emissions.

This report examines housing affordability in England from 1997 to 2022 using data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It analyzes trends and regional disparities. Findings reveal a significant decline in affordability, with house prices growing faster than wages, especially in southern regions like London. The affordability ratio, based on five years of income, highlights these challenges.
